Changes:
1. Add permission system so that user who's not file owner can have access to the
file owner files if the owner allows them to do so.
2. Better backup function
3. Add zip import function
4. Add a label to allow users to view their file storage used storage in upload and deleting file
5. Remove the dummy login/registration. (Server side will still have this function,
reserve for keys decentralized version[Corporate/Company])
6. Add parallel functions for non file owner user.
7. Have a better and less confusing UI

Warning:
1. The import and backup function that sources from C# is kinda buggy. More on that later. 

There may be more to come, it depends on the changes on server side.
