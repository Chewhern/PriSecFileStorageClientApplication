# Creating Service file
1. Navigate to this link for more information(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?view=aspnetcore-6.0).
2. Open the terminal and type in ``sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kestrel-helloapp.service``\
The ``kestrel-helloapp.service`` is a sample service file name with its extension.\
In our case, you will need to do ``sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kestrel-prisecfilestorageclientweb.service``
3. You will need to remember the ``kestrel-prisecfilestorageclientweb.service`` service file's name else you can't stop it from running 24/7.
